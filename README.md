## 🔧 Extra Features (Server/LAN Required)
If the mod is **installed on the server** (or if you are playing on a **LAN world hosted by someone with the mod**), you unlock additional features:
- 🔭 Ability to track players **even if they are outside of your render distance**.  

⚠️ These additional features are **not possible on unmodded servers** because Minecraft itself does not allow sending player position data unless the mod is present on the server.

2. Download and place the latest release `.jar` into your `mods/` folder.
