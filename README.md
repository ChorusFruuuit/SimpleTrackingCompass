# Simple Tracking Compass

**Simple Tracking Compass** is a Fabric mod that adds a compass HUD to the top-left corner of your screen.  
It lets you track other players, which can be especially useful for **manhunts** or other competitive challenges.

## ✨ Features
- 📍 Shows a compass in the HUD. (Can be hidden)
- 🧭 Lets you track other players.  
- 👥 Great for multiplayer survival, challenges, and manhunts.

## 🔧 Extra Features (Server/LAN Required)
If the mod is **installed on the server** (or if you are playing on a **LAN world hosted by someone with the mod**), you unlock additional features:
- 🔭 Ability to track players **even if they are outside of your render distance**.  

⚠️ These additional features are **not possible on unmodded servers** because Minecraft itself does not allow sending player position data unless the mod is present on the server.
